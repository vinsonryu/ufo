üîë Key Insights
Sightings Growth: UFO sightings surged after the 1980s, peaked in the 1990s, and declined in the 2010s‚Äîpossibly due to public disinterest or better scientific explanations.

Geographic Distribution:

USA dominates with 65K+ reports, followed by Canada at only 3K reports.

Zero reports from Russia, Greenland, and several regions in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.

Sightings decrease as we move eastward and northward.

Sighting Types:

Light-like sightings are the most common (16K+ reports).

Followed by triangle and circle shapes (~7K each).

Seasonality:

Peak sightings occur in summer, while winter (Feb‚ÄìApr) sees the fewest.

Flash, cone, light, and fireball are most common in peak months.

Longest Recorded Sightings:

In 1993, sphere-shaped sightings lasted 97M+ seconds (across only 4 sightings).

Interestingly, the longest sightings were not in the U.S. but in Great Britain (Finley & Greenbrier).

Average Duration: Crescent-shaped UFOs are observed for the longest average time.
